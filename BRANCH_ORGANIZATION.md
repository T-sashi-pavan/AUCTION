git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

# Push your changes
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### 🔄 Staying Updated:
```bash
# Regularly pull updates from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge main into your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch-name
git merge main

# Resolve any conflicts if they arise
# Push the updated branch
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### 📋 Collaboration Guidelines:
