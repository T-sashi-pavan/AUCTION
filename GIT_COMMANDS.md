git pull origin your-branch-name

# 2. Work on your features and make changes
# ... edit your files ...

# 3. Check what files you've changed

git pull origin main

# Switch back to your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch-name

# Merge main into your branch to get latest updates
git merge main

# Push the updated branch
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### Working with Multiple Files:
```bash
# Add all modified files

### Branch Management:
```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Create a new branch (if needed)
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Delete a local branch (careful!)
git branch -d branch-name

# Rename current branch
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

### Viewing Changes:
```bash
# See what changes you've made
git diff

# See changes in a specific file
git diff src/main/java/com/auction/services/impl/AdminServiceImpl.java

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# See changes between branches
git diff main..feature/your-branch-name
```

### Undoing Changes:
```bash
# Undo changes to a specific file (before commit)
git checkout -- filename.java

# Undo all changes (before commit)
git checkout .

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes) - BE CAREFUL!
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Creating Pull Requests:
1. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-branch-name`

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### "Your branch is behind"
```bash
git pull origin your-branch-name
```

#### "Merge conflicts"
1. Open the conflicted files
2. Look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Edit the file to resolve conflicts
4. Remove the conflict markers
5. Add and commit the resolved files:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

#### "Permission denied" or authentication issues
- Make sure you have access to the repository
- Use your GitHub credentials when prompted
- Consider using a personal access token instead of password

#### "Files not staging"
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Force add if needed
git add -f filename.java
```

## ðŸ“‹ Best Practices

1. **Commit often**: Make small, frequent commits
2. **Descriptive messages**: Write clear commit messages
3. **Pull regularly**: Stay updated with main branch
4. **Test before push**: Make sure your code compiles and runs
5. **Backup your work**: Push regularly to avoid losing work

## ðŸŽ¯ Team Coordination

- **Daily standup**: Share what you're working on
- **Code review**: Review each other's pull requests
- **Documentation**: Update documentation when adding features
- **Testing**: Test your features thoroughly
- **Communication**: Use GitHub issues or discussions for coordination
